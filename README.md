# ken_ken_generator
This python program uses both backtracking and reportlab to output ken_ken boards as pdfs. It will also produce another pdf file, the answer key, in case you get stuck, and you need a hint. If you are not familiar with ken_ken, ken_ken is a japanese board game. You can learn about it more in here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KenKen.
